Please note that this app was created based on this tutorial https://www.js-tutorials.com/nodejs-tutorial/node-js-user-authentication-using-mysql-express-js/
on how to create authentication system using nodejs.
Even though my website is different in structure and code it was based on that tutorial.

note that these are my sql connection properties used in the app:
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 3306,
  user: 'root',
  password: ''


how to start the app.
1.cd to register-unit and run:
	npm install
	node app.js
2.cd to login-unit and run:
	npm install
	node app.js
3.cd to home-unit and run:
	npm install
	npm start
last command will run home-unit and open browser window on login.
 
Sincerely,
Mohamed Roza
